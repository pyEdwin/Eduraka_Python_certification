Case Study

Domain: Banking

Focus:OptimizationBusiness

challenge/requirement

FinBank is the latest entrant in the banking market of Thailand.

The verification process for opening a bank account is done manually by reviewing the photocopy of the

approved ID card. However, they have recently introduced a system where the customers’ fingerprints

will be mapped with the newly introduced Unique ID for citizens of Thailand by the government.

FinBankshould implement a system that verifies customers against theirfingerprintsand Unique Id.

Key issues Build a system where when a user enters a Unique ID,it gets encrypted so that hackers

cannot view the mapping of the Unique ID and fingerprint.ConsiderationsThe system should be

secure.

Data volume -NA

Additional information -NA

Business benefits

The bank will be able to verify customers’ data quickly, and the expected gain in volume is approximately ten times as the manual process of verification is replaced with asecure automated

system.

Approach to solve

1.Read the input from the command line –UniqueID.

2.Check for validityof Unique ID–it should be 10 digits and must containonly numbers.

3.Encrypt the UniqueID and print it.

Enhancements for code

You can try these enhancements in code.

1.Allow alphabets and some special characters in Unique ID

2.Providethe option for decryption to the user.
